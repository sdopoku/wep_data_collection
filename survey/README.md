# Survey Development

The survey was developed by team from the Women Environmental Programme (WEP), National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and Open Knowledge International (OKI). This work spanned March through July, a few days before training of the data collectors.

### Stages

The final version of the survey was deployed through the [Kobo Toolbox data collection kit](http://www.kobotoolbox.org). Below is a description of the process we followed to develop the final version of the survey.

#### Step 1: Decide on a data collection methodology

The first stage involved deciding on the right approach for data collection and clearly defining the roles of each of the teams. The WEP team gave an overview of the data collection project and expected outcomes and provided their thoughts on a possible approach using paper-based survey. The OKI team then proposed employing a mobile data collection approach to make the process less cumbersome and obtain more accurate data. The team then shared the [Easy Guide To Mobile Data Collection](http://schoolofdata.org/2016/02/15/the-easy-guide-to-mobile-data-collection/) resource developed by [School of Data]() with the WEP team as an introduction to mobile data collection. This resource also was useful in the designing the training for the data collectors later on. The three team agreed to perform the following roles for the project:

- Women Environmental Programme: Project Coordination
- National Bureau of Statistics: Statistics and Analysis Support
- Open Knowledge International: Data Collection Design and Implementation Support



#### Step 2: Draft a survey schema/structure
In the second step, the WEP team designed a draft survey that covers the questions that will like to get from members of the target communities. This effort was led by the WEP Project Manager for the data collection project. Below is a view of the first page of the draft schema.

#### Step 3: Review & finalise the schema
In the third step, WEP shared the draft schema with the NBS and OKI teams for review. Several suggestions and changes were made based on the feasibility of the intended insights WEP wanted to gain from this project. For instance, the question on **Estimated number of households in community** was removed from the final version of the survey due to the high likely of receiving a range of answers that would not be useful for any analysis. Below is a view of the first apge of the final schema.

A copy of the final schema can be downloaded from the survey folder.

#### Step 4: Adapt schema to mobile data collection platform
In the fourth stage, the OKI team converted the final schema into a Kobo Toolbox form that could be deployed on Android smartphones. Several validations and meta data was included into the mobile form to reduce extra manual entry, errors and collect data for validation and analysis purpose. Some of these extra features included:
- pre-populated area council, ward and community selections
- validations for expected data types
- skip logic to avoid non-applicable responses
- data collection time and data for validation purposes
- geo location information
- pictures of data collection site for additional validation and documentation of findings.
