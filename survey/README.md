# Survey development

The survey was developed by team from the Women Environmental Programme (WEP), National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and Open Knowledge International (OKI). This work spanned March through July, a few days before training of the data collectors.

### Stages

The final version of the survey was deployed through the [Kobo Toolbox data collection kit](http://www.kobotoolbox.org). Below is a description of the process we followed to develop the final version of the survey.

#### Step 1: Decide on a data collection methodology

The first stage involved deciding on the right approach for data collection and clearly defining the roles of each of the teams. The WEP team gave an overview of the data collection project and expected outcomes and provided their thoughts on a possible approach using paper-based survey. The OKI team then proposed employing a mobile data collection approach to make the process less cumbersome and obtain more accurate data. The team then shared the [Easy Guide To Mobile Data Collection](http://schoolofdata.org/2016/02/15/the-easy-guide-to-mobile-data-collection/) resource developed by [School of Data]() with the WEP team as an introduction to mobile data collection. This resource also was useful in the designing the training for the data collectors later on. The three team agreed to perform the following roles for the project:

- Women Environmental Programmme: Project Coordination
- National Bureau of Statistics: Statistics and Analysis Support
- Open Knowledge International: Data Collection Design and Implementation Support



#### Step 2: Draft a survey schema/structure

#### Step 3: Review & finalise the schema

#### Step 4: Adapt schema to mobile data collection platform
